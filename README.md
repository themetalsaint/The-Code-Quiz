### The Code Quiz


At some point in the journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment—perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help familiarize myself with these tests and allow me to use the skills I have learned, I built a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## First Hand Experience

This project felt like the first really hard challenge for me. I was struggling with functions and was struggling to finish this homework. I came back to this homework after completing my certificate program as practice.
