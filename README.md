The Code Quiz - Homework 4


My Task:
"At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment—perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this unit, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface."


This project felt liek teh first really hard challenge for me. I am struggling with functions and am struggling to finish this homework. I hope that I can show case a minor amount of skill and that I can come back to this one in the hopes of improving upin it as time goes on.
